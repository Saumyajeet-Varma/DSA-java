# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

> Medium

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]`, there is **only one duplicate number** in `nums`, but it could be repeated more than once.  
Return *the duplicate number*.

### Example:
- Input: `nums = [1,3,4,2,2]`  
- Output: `2`

- Input: `nums = [3,1,3,4,2]`  
- Output: `3`

- Input: `nums = [1,1]`  
- Output: `1`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10⁵`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times
